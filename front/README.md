### Boilerplate

I am using the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) boilerplate here, it's very powerful to setup a React project.

### Styled components

Using styled components allows me to use css-in-js the same way we use React for html-in-js. It makes it easier to condition our design using js.

### react-select

Selects can be a pain in the a\*\*, therefore, I am using a lib that handles it for me.

### axios

We are using axios here to send http requests to the api. Its api is pretty straightforward in comparison of the native fetch API.

### typescript

Typescript is a great way to avoid runtime errors by having a strong typing in JavaScript. JS is powerful, even more with types.
